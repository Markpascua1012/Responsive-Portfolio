        Hello, my name is Mark Anthony Pascua. I am 24 years old and I currently reside in Irvine, California. 
        I was born in San Bernardino, but moved to Orange County when I was just a baby. Once I was in 7th grade
        my mom wanted a change so we moved to Hawaii and I lived there up until my senior year of high school
        and moved back to the OC. I graduated from Tustin High School and moved on to IVC. Throughout the years I 
        have constantly switched my major, moving from parttime to parttime job. I later figured out that I wanted
        to major in buisness marketing with a minor in graphic design. I'm currently taking the coding bootcamp to
        broaden my skill vocabulary so I can become more competative in my future job as well as picking up
        a job while I finish out school so I can get out of parttime work. I currently work two jobs as a Bartender
        at one resturant and a Server at another. My interests include Video games, Dogs, Anime, Travel, Fashion, Music, Dance, 
        and pop culture. I am a complete nerd once you get to know me. Through my time in college I danced hip
        hop in a collegiate dance team called Kaba Modern. I've made many friends and had a lot of experiences 
        with my teammates, but proceeded to end my time there to focus on my future. I am excited to push and experience
        more things in the future :).
